# speaker-keepalive
 A simple tray programm that outputs a weak signal to the speakers to prevent automatic muting.
 
 Just open it, then right-click on the icon and choose "Enable keepalive output".
 By default it has 25 kHz frequency and 0.01% of volume, so it will be an inaudible sinewave signal and won't affect the general sound.
 
 You can also find a standalone .exe in the releases section.
